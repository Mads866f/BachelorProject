            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Participatory budgeting (PB) is a type of citizen sourcing in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a municipal or public budget through a process of democratic deliberation and decision-making. Participatory budgeting allows citizens or residents of a locality to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.[1]
                Participatory budgeting processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth.[2] A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government transparency and accountability, increased levels of public participation (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning.[3] Participatory budgeting stands as one of several democratic innovationsâ€”such as British Columbia's Citizens' Assemblyâ€”encompassing the ideals of a participatory democracy.[4]
                Frameworks of participatory budgeting differ throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. Participatory budgeting, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of participatory budgeting vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, participatory budgeting has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, participatory budgeting has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology.[5] As of 2014, participatory budgeting has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.[4]1

                Method Of Equal Shares
            </MudText>
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                The method of equal shares[1][2][3][4] is a proportional method of counting ballots that applies to participatory budgeting,[2] to committee elections,[3] and to simultaneous public decisions.[4][5] It can be used when the voters vote via approval ballots, ranked ballots or cardinal ballots. It works by dividing the available budget into equal parts that are assigned to each voter. The method is only allowed to use the budget share of a voter to implement projects that the voter voted for. It then repeatedly finds projects that can be afforded using the budget shares of the supporting voters. In contexts other than participatory budgeting, the method works by equally dividing an abstract budget of "voting power".[1]

                In 2023, the method of equal shares was being used in a participatory budgeting program in the Polish city of Wieliczka.[6] The program, known as Green Million (Zielony Milion), was set to distribute 1 million zÅ‚oty to ecological projects proposed by residents of the city. It was also used in a participatory budgeting program in the Swiss city of Aarau in 2023 (Stadtidee).[7]
